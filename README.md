# ReactFoodOrderingApp

This is a food ordering App created using my React knowledge. It utilizes some of the basic concept of react, which includes states, hooks, components, reducers,
refs, and etc. In addition, this project communicates with a back-end server to fetch data. The backend app used is google firebase. That is where I stored
data such as menu items and their information. When the webpage loads, that's when the app communicates with the backend to get that data. The backend also
stores data when a user submits an order by choosing the meals that they would like to order, their address, as well as their name.
